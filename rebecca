    <h2>Flute</h2>
    <p>I've been playing the flute since the summer of 2014 and am still currently learning. I attend flute lessons weekly, every Friday, and also join the Gradus ad Parnassum youth orchestra.</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#fffcff;">
    <h2>Hip-Hop and Swimming</h2>
    <p>Hip hop has been a different type of dance style than the ones I've done before. Before joining in hip-hop, I did ballet and tap. I quit tap early on, but started losing intrest in ballet when I found out I would need surgery for my knee if I wanted to continue. This is when I started doing hip-hop. The beats and sharper technique really help and interst me. Every Wednesday, I do hip hop with my dance school, NDS, standing for Nijikko Dance School. Swimming is also one of my favorite activites. I really enjoy the feeling of being in water and have done swimming for most of my life.</p>

    <h2>Chinese School</h2>
    <p>Although most people find Chinese school as a pain, I enjoy it, most of the time. Not only do I get to learn Mandarin, I get to see two of my closest friends, Anna and Kylie, and my other friends that I only get to see once a week, since they attend other neighboring schools.</p>
